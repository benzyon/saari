      <p>I'm a writer that loves to make characters more than actually writing. I normally draw my characters and love to Rp with them. A lot of them are fighters and their stories are full of action.</p>
      <p>If you are ever looking for a character that can fight or really take a hit, my characters are one of them. That or they are really shy or just anti social. Its almost a mix but at the same time not. </p>
