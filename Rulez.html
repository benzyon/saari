      <h3>Basic </h3>
      <p>This is supposed to be a light hearted roleplay. Characters can talk about their dark past and all that but please leave the dark stuff back in there world. Character come to this roleplay room through sleeping, getting knocked unconscious or other means of passing out.</p>
      <p>Characters who are not in the database will be silenced until they are in the data base. You can still lurk and not enter the room with the character not in the data base however do not join until they are registered. Its more of a security measure and to play responsibily on the player.</p>

      <h4>How your character gets to the world</h4>
      <p>Your character fell asleep in their world and sudenly ended up in this one. Its like a dream, they don't know how they got there, they just are.</p>
     </div>
    <div class="columns">
      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/VHLrm3S.png" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>When your character returns to their world</h4>
      <p>When your characters go back to their world, they don't remember anything from the rp until they return. Once they return, they remember everything that has happened there [well as much as your remember] </p>
     </div>
    <div class="columns">
      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/bNmJAMU.png" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>Your Characters can not take items back with them that they didnt take with them</h4>
      <p>If someone takes something, it is left behind when they disappear. If someone eats something it will reappear where it was taken from, untouched. If they give someone something, it will fade out when they do.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="columns">
      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hLbTgHl.png" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>This is not meant to be a stressful </h4>
      <p>Keep the drama to a minimum. If it gets too crazy tell the person causing it to please stop or if you are too shy to do that you can change characters or try and contact someone else to talk with them. it is meant to be fun and a place to develop characters. </p>
      <p>Along with that DONT BE A JERK </p>

      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/6mJGGlo.jpg" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>This is a romance free roleplay</h4>
      <p>This is a place for characters to meet and make friends and get developted. Its not for characters to find their soulmate or significant other. If you and the other author decide that your characters are perfect for each other, make a seperate NON CANNON room. Relationships start unnecessary drama in the room. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="columns">
      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/nfasefr.png" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>No sex in any shape or form.</h4>
      <p>This is not an R/NR roleplay room. If your character cant keep it in their pants then dont bring them in. If you and the other author want your characters to get it on, like the relationship thing, NON CANNON room.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columns">
      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/9nmmxla.png" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>No killing characters with out permission</h4>
      <p>Dont kill each others characters unless the author gives you permission. If your character does get 'killed' they dont actually die, they wake up in their world as if you died in a dream though they dont remember. If you have a murderous character, unless they can control themselves, dont bring them in please.</p>

      <h4>The place cleans it self</h4>
      <p>They place has magic cleaning roombas that activate automatically when ever something gets dirty, is spilt, breaks, ect. All the floors are hard wood and the roombas can climb walls if something was splattered against them.</p>

      <h4>Time of day</h4>
      <p>The time of day and season in the given area never change. The time of day is always going to be about 2-3 in the afternoon [14-15 military time]. However in the black forest it is always dark though not dark enough that you cant see.</p>

      <h4>Swearing is allowed </h4>
      <p>Just try not to go overboard with it though I'm not going to be strict about it. I will be if its making other authors uncomfortable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="columns">
      <p class="thumbnail_align"> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/PC4TWze.png" alt="" class="thumbnail"/> </p>
      <h4>You must have your character in the database</h4>
      <p> There will be a place for you to put your characters. It would be nice to 1. Have a reference to go back on in case someone forgot the character 2. You can be like Ã¢ÂÂi donÃ¢ÂÂt know who to bring in, pick one.Ã¢ÂÂ 3. It helps keep track of who has which character 4. If a troll comes along we know they donÃ¢ÂÂt belong though that probably wont be an issue. </p>
